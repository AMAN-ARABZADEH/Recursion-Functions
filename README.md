# Recursive Functions
I have written this code to explore and test various recursive functions.


This repository contains a collection of recursive functions implemented in C++.
Recursive functions are functions that call themselves, allowing for elegant and concise solutions to various problems.
The purpose of this repository is to explore and demonstrate the power and versatility of recursive functions in solving common programming challenges.

## Functions

The repository includes the following recursive functions:

- `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- `fibonacci`: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
- `binarySearch`: Performs binary search on a sorted array.
- `sumOfDigits`: Calculates the sum of digits in a number.
- `reverseString`: Reverses a string.
- `power`: Calculates the exponentiation of a number.
- `gcd`: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- `sumOfArray`: Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.
- `binaryRepresentation`: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation.
- `towerOfHanoi`: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
- `isPalindrome`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `sumOfNaturalNumbers`: Calculates the sum of natural numbers up to a given number.
- `findMax`: Finds the maximum element in an array.
- `mergeSort`: Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.
- `decimalToBinary1`: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation (alternative implementation).
- `countOccurrences`: Counts the occurrences of a value in an array.
- `towerOfAnoih`: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle (alternative implementation).
- `stringLength`: Calculates the length of a string.
- `sumOfEvenNumbers`: Calculates the sum of even numbers in an array.
- `powerExpo`: Calculates the exponentiation of a number (improved version).
- `decimalToBinary`: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation (returns a string).
- `printRange`: Prints numbers in a given range.
- `isPrime`: Checks if a number is prime.
- `isPalindromeNoneAlphanumeric`: Checks if a string is a palindrome (ignoring non-alphanumeric characters).
- `countVowels`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.

Feel free to explore each function and its implementation in the corresponding source files.

## Usage

To use the recursive functions in your own projects, you can simply copy the desired function(s) from the source file and include them in your code.
Each function is self-contained and can be used independently.

Ensure that you have a C++ compiler and the necessary dependencies set up in your development environment.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, you're welcome to submit pull requests with additional recursive functions,
improvements to existing functions, bug fixes, or any other enhancements. 
Please make sure to follow the existing coding style and provide appropriate documentation and test cases for your changes.
